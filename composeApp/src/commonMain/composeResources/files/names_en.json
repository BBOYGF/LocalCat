The software is divided into Android mobile and Windows desktop versions. Through a local network, multiple phone contents can be backed up to a specified directory on the desktop at any time. The software supports breakpoint resume, dividing large files into 1MB blocks for uploading to the computer. If the upload is interrupted, it can be resumed next time. The software also supports automatic discovery and uploading of new files. Users can set filtering conditions for the directories to be uploaded, and the software will automatically scan the current directory for any new files and upload them to the computer if found. This software is suitable for users who frequently need to upload phone data to the computer for processing. It can help you reduce a lot of tedious work and focus on more important things.",
